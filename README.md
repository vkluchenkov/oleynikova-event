This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Description

Fairly simple multilingual landing page for a dance event â€” with a few complications such as sending emails through Sendinblue integration (emails generated with MJML), saving form submissions in Notion and processing PayPal / Stripe payments.
